# Bottom-mua dynamic-tail TPSF model

`train_bottom_mua_dynamic_tail.py` predicts a bottom-layer absorption
coefficient (`bottom_absorption_mul`) from time-of-flight photon
distributions (TPSFs), using a per-wavelength dynamic "late tail" window
defined by a `LATE_START` index.

This is a standalone training script (paths in `TRAIN_DIR`,
`WAVELENGTH_FILE`, and `MODEL_PATH` are local Windows paths meant to be
edited for your machine) and is unrelated to the spleen-ultrasound
pipeline described in the top-level `README.md`; it lives in its own
folder for that reason.

## Changes made to reduce validation error

Starting from the original full-TPSF + raw-tail convolutional model, this
version adds:

1. **Fixed an augmentation wiring bug.** The training `Dataset` was always
   constructed with `augment=False`, so the amplitude-jitter/additive-noise
   /time-shift augmentation implemented in `augment_scaled_tpsf` never ran
   during training regardless of `USE_TRAINING_AUGMENTATION`. It is now
   wired to the flag, and the flag defaults to `True`.
2. **Statistical-moment features.** `compute_moment_features` derives
   total counts, mean time-of-flight, temporal standard deviation,
   skewness, peak amplitude, and peak time from both the full TPSF and the
   raw tail, and these are concatenated into the fusion vector alongside
   the convolutional features. These are the same low-order moments used
   by generalized method-of-moments absorption estimators in diffuse
   optics, so they give the regression head a physically grounded, low-
   variance signal that does not depend solely on what the CNN encoders
   manage to learn from a limited number of training images.
3. **Nonlinear wavelength embedding.** The normalized wavelength is now
   passed through a small `Linear(1, 8) -> ReLU -> Linear(8, 4)` encoder
   instead of being concatenated as a single raw scalar, since chromophore
   absorption spectra are not linear functions of wavelength.
4. **Larger per-step image batch.** `IMAGE_BATCH_SIZE` was raised from 1 to
   4 so that each optimizer step averages gradients over TPSFs drawn from
   several different phantoms/images, reducing gradient noise from
   within-image correlation (169 wavelengths from the same phantom share
   the same bottom-layer geometry).

## Further options worth trying on your data

These were not applied because they need to be tuned against real
training curves / target scale, which are not available here:

- If validation MAE is dominated by a few high-`mua` outliers, try
  `nn.SmoothL1Loss(beta=...)` in place of `RawMuaLoss`'s `F.l1_loss` (the
  validation MAE/RMSE metrics are computed independently of the training
  criterion, so this only changes optimization dynamics, not what is
  reported).
- If training loss is still falling but validation loss has plateaued,
  increase `HEAD_DROPOUT`/`TEMPORAL_DROPOUT` or `WEIGHT_DECAY` slightly.
- If the model is instead underfitting (train and validation MAE both
  high and close together), increase `TEMPORAL_FILTERS_PER_KERNEL` or
  `TEMPORAL_FEATURE_DIM` before adding more regularization.
- Consider k-fold cross-validation across images instead of a single
  80/20 split if the number of training images is small, since a single
  split can make the reported validation MAE noisy from run to run.
